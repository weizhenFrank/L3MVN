User:
I observe the following clusters of objects while exploring a house:

1. sofa, tv, speaker
2. desk, chair, computer
3. sink, microwave, refrigerator

Where should I avoid spending time searching if I am looking for a knife?

Assistant:
Reasoning: Cluster 1 contains items that are likely part of an entertainment room. Cluster 2 contains objects that are likely part of an office room and cluster 3 contains items likely found in a kitchen. A knife is not likely to be in an entertainment room or an office room so we should avoid searching those spaces.

1. You will only be given a list of common items found in the environment. You will not be given room labels. Use your best judgment when determining what room a cluster of objects is likely to be in.
